    "# CryoNIRSP Level 1 FITS Data:  Coronal spectral line fitting (spectroscopy and polarimetry)\n",
    "\n",
    "DKIST | NSO | CRYONIRSP | 10 September 2024 \n",
    "--> Prepared for the first CryoNIRSP Data Release by Tom Schad (tschad@nso.edu) \n",
    "\n",
    "**Goals of this notebook:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*  This notebook is provided to DKIST/CryoNIRSP users by the CryoNIRSP team to illustrate ways to work with the coronal spectral data. \n",
    "*  The notebook loads CryoNIRSP SP data from the L1 fits files and performs spectral line fits to extract coronal parameters while also accounting for background scattered light introduced by the combination of the sky and telescope + instrument.  It then creates maps of these quantities.\n",
    "*  It also does full polarimetric line fits, which also mitigates polarimetric crosstalk, in order to extract the line and continuum linear polarization as the line Zeeman circular polarized signal for longitudinal magnetic field diagnostics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**About the CryoNIRSP data release:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* On 21 August 2024, the Level 1 data pipeline for the Cryo-NIRSP reached its first official release within the Data Center software stack (https://docs.dkist.nso.edu/projects/cryo-nirsp/en/latest/) \n",
    "* The backlog of Cycle 2 CryoNIRSP data was then bulk processed, of which 85 percent was successful and then made available, in accordance with the DKIST Data Policy via the DKIST Data Center Data Archive (https://dkist.data.nso.edu/).\n",
    "* This is the first public release of the CryoNIRSP spectrograph and context imager data, and it comprises only off-limb coronagraphic data.  Many technical challenges have been overcome to reach this point; albeit, many additional ones (known and unknown) remain.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**About the data used in this notebook:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A single dataset from Cycle 2 Experiment #119 is used here.  This experiment collected many different types of datasets around the time of the April 2024 total solar eclipse that traversed North America. This data resulted from a Director's Discretionary Time (DDT) proposal and all of its data is publically available without an embargo period.\n",
    "* The dataset used here has an Dataset ID of BZJOM.  This ID is assigned by the Data Center.  The Observing Program ID assigned at the time of execution on summit is \"eid_2_119_opr0oJqs_R001.150682.6087226\"\n",
    "* The data consists of a spectropolarimetric raster scan that is centered on the Fe XIII 1074 nm coronal line.  The scan consisted of 51 scan step positions (i.e. scanning of the image across the slit).  At each step position, a full Stokes measurement was acquired 10 times.  Within the Level 1 calibrated data, each unique Stokes parameter, scan step, and repeated measurement are saved into a single RICE compressed FITS file.  And so, in this case, there are 4*51*10 = 2040 FITS files.  \n",
    "* Data may be downloaded from:   https://dkist.data.nso.edu?datasetId=BZJOM\n",
    "* Other datasets in the experiment are available in the data archive:  https://dkist.data.nso.edu/?proposalId=pid_2_119\n",
    "* *Supplemental data:* We use solar and telluric atlases as part of the model fitting processes.  These are automatically downloaded from the source repositorites via the code in this notebook. See below for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important disclaimers:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The data used in this notebook must be downloaded from the Data Center prior to running it.**\n",
    "* This notebook is **NOT** meant to serve as a definitive ``black box'' for CryoNIRSP spectral analysis.  The novelty and challenges of coronagraphic spectral data require more concerted efforts on the behalf of users to engage with and improve spectral analysis methods.  Feedback to the CryoNIRSP team is encouraged. \n",
    "* The ASDF files included in the data distribution have known flaws and errors for the CryoNIRSP data at this time, in particular relating to metadata.  It is thus recommended to work with FITS files directly, as shown in this notebook.\n",
    "* Analysis methods subject to change. \n",
